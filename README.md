## Starting the App Locally
* Start by installing front and backend dependencies. Run the following commands within the binder folder and the frontend folder:

### Configuration
* Open config/localhost.js - Set your custom configs
* 

### Backend
* On the Binder folder itself, run npm install - This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.
* Run npm run db:reset:localhost - This command will drop all the database tables.
* Run npm start after running the above two commands

### Frontend
* Open the frontend folder and run npm install - This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.
* After completing the above step, run npm start. Your app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
